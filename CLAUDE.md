# Claude Code Rules
4) Add follow‑ups and risks (max 3 bullets).
5) Create PHR in appropriate subdirectory under `history/prompts/` (constitution, feature-name, or general).
6) If plan/tasks identified decisions that meet significance, surface ADR suggestion text as described above.

### Minimum acceptance criteria
- Clear, testable acceptance criteria included
- Explicit error paths and constraints stated
- Smallest viable change; no unrelated edits
- Code references to modified/inspected files where relevant

## Architect Guidelines (for planning)

Instructions: As an expert architect, generate a detailed architectural plan for [Project Name]. Address each of the following thoroughly.

1. Scope and Dependencies:
   - In Scope: boundaries and key features.
   - Out of Scope: explicitly excluded items.
   - External Dependencies: systems/services/teams and ownership.

2. Key Decisions and Rationale:
   - Options Considered, Trade-offs, Rationale.
   - Principles: measurable, reversible where possible, smallest viable change.

3. Interfaces and API Contracts:
   - Public APIs: Inputs, Outputs, Errors.
   - Versioning Strategy.
   - Idempotency, Timeouts, Retries.
   - Error Taxonomy with status codes.

4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and Budgets:
   - Performance: p95 latency, throughput, resource caps.
   - Reliability: SLOs, error budgets, degradation strategy.
   - Security: AuthN/AuthZ, data handling, secrets, auditing.
   - Cost: unit economics.

5. Data Management and Migration:
   - Source of Truth, Schema Evolution, Migration and Rollback, Data Retention.

6. Operational Readiness:
   - Observability: logs, metrics, traces.
   - Alerting: thresholds and on-call owners.
   - Runbooks for common tasks.
   - Deployment and Rollback strategies.
   - Feature Flags and compatibility.

7. Risk Analysis and Mitigation:
   - Top 3 Risks, blast radius, kill switches/guardrails.

8. Evaluation and Validation:
   - Definition of Done (tests, scans).
   - Output Validation for format/requirements/safety.

9. Architectural Decision Record (ADR):
   - For each significant decision, create an ADR and link it.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Intelligent Suggestion

After design/architecture work, test for ADR significance:

- Impact: long-term consequences? (e.g., framework, data model, API, security, platform)
- Alternatives: multiple viable options considered?
- Scope: cross‑cutting and influences system design?

If ALL true, suggest:
📋 Architectural decision detected: [brief-description]
   Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr [decision-title]`

Wait for consent; never auto-create ADRs. Group related decisions (stacks, authentication, deployment) into one ADR when appropriate.

## Basic Project Structure

- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — Project principles
- `specs/<feature>/spec.md` — Feature requirements
- `specs/<feature>/plan.md` — Architecture decisions
- `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` — Testable tasks with cases
- `history/prompts/` — Prompt History Records
- `history/adr/` — Architecture Decision Records
- `.specify/` — SpecKit Plus templates and scripts

## Code Standards
See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for code quality, testing, performance, security, and architecture principles.
