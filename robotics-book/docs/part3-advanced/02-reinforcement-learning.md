# Reinforcement Learning Applications

**Estimated Reading Time:** 30 minutes
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Prerequisites:** Part 1-2, Machine learning, Python

## Learning Objectives

- Understand RL fundamentals (MDP, value functions, policies)
- Implement PPO and SAC for robot control
- Handle sample efficiency challenges
- Evaluate RL policies safely

## Content Coming Soon

This chapter will cover RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, TD3), reward shaping, sample efficiency, and safe RL for physical robots.
